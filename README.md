  - **Floor**: Manages the map generation, room connections, and validation.
  - **Combat**: Handles combat mechanics between the player and enemies.
  - **ScreenBuffer**: Manages console screen output and animations.

- **Data Structures**:
  - **DoublyLinkedList**: Custom implementation for managing player and enemy movements.
  - **Stack**: Custom stack implementation for managing attack cards.
  - **Queue**: Custom queue implementation used for room traversal.

- **Utility Functions**:
  - **roomTypeToString**: Converts room type enums to strings.
  - **stringToRoomType**: Converts strings to room type enums.
  - **gotoxy**: Moves the console cursor to a specific position.
  - **fullsc**: Sets the console to full screen.
  - **hideCursor**: Hides the console cursor for a clean interface.
  - **readFramesFromFile**: Reads sprite frames from text files.

## How to Build
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the project with the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 GoingUp.cpp -o GoingUp.exe
4. Run executable: 
   ```bash
   ./GoingUp.exe
## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: 
   Run the game by executing the compiled `GoingUp.exe` or `./GoingUp` on your system.

2. **Navigate Through Rooms**: 
   Use the provided options to move through different room types, such as Spawn, Treasure, Trap, Large, and Boss rooms. The console interface will display the available options for you to choose from.

3. **Encounter Enemies and Engage in Combat**:
